From Lecture 1:
It captures something which is obvious to people in the Valley, but not yet
obvious to the rest of the world, which is that anything which has an
informational component - which is pretty much every industry - is going to be
hollowed out with a database and an API at the centre of it. And the company
that does that is going to have operational efficiencies that are far greater
than any of the existing incumbents. And that's what's happening right now, with
Uber doing that for taxis, and AirBnB doing it for hotels, and I'd say that our
company Counsyl is doing that to some extent in laboratories and for genomics.


From "Software is Eating the World":
Secondly, many people in the U.S. and around the world lack the education and
skills required to participate in the great new companies coming out of the
software revolution. This is a tragedy since every company I work with is
absolutely starved for talent. Qualified software engineers, managers, marketers
and salespeople in Silicon Valley can rack up dozens of high-paying, high-upside
job offers any time they want, while national unemployment and underemployment
is sky high. This problem is even worse than it looks because many workers in
existing industries will be stranded on the wrong side of software-based
disruption and may never be able to work in their fields again.There's no way
through this problem other than education, and we have a long way to go.
